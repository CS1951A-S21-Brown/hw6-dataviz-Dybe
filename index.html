            <h1>Written Questions</h1>
            <p>

                Question 1
            </p>
            <p>
                In the first question I answer the question by using a barplot of the total number of matches (x-axis)
                and the corresponding year. I allow the user to compare the number of matches in recent years versus the
                number of matches in distant years, early 1900s, by buttons on top of the barplot. The buttons allow the
                user to toggle between 2015 - 2020 and 1900-1905.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use a barplot of winning percentages (x-axis) against their corresponding country (y-axis) to show
                what countries are the top 10 countries in terms of winning percentage since the beginning of football.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the last question, I used a word cloud to show what countries are most likely to win the next world
                cup by their winning percentages in the last two world cups. The larger the size of the name of the
                country, the more likely the country is to win the world cup.I use a tooltip to reveal the winning of
                the countries if the cursor moves over the name of the country
                in the world cloud. The tooltip shows way outside the word cloud to make sure that it does not block
                other words when it appears. It made sure that the user can notice the tooltip by giving it color and
                bold font weight.
            </p>


            <p>Question 2</p>
            <p> i)D3 allowed me to choose from a myriad of graphs and other visual options of how to communicate the
                data.</p>
            <p>ii)D3 allowed me to use DOM elements such as buttons to allow users to easily interact with the data and
                toggle between subsets of the data.</p>

            <p>iii) D33 allowed me to benefit from CSS and use it to style my dashboard in order to enhance clarity of
                the data.</p>

            <p>
                Question 3
            </p>
            <p>
                i) I found the D3 learning curve to be quite steep, at times, I felt like I would prefer using python
                and
                its libraries.
            </p>

            <p>
                ii)SVGs do not natively support text-wrapping without using javascript, which is easily achievable using
                HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
                iii) There is limited opportunity to refactor code compared to python. Chained styling of the elements
                can
                make the code harder to read and debug especially as a beginner.
            </p>



            <p>
                Question 4
            </p>

            <p>
                My Dashboard is accessible to people with weaker vision and color blindness as I use strong contrast and
                colors that are more readable for color blind people and have avoided colors that would be harder to see
                and appreciate the data for people with Protranopia as suggested by Amanda Miller of the Betterment
                article. I also use SVGs for the graphs which are better for screen readers than basic HTML. Moreover my
                graphs have accessible axis labels.
                I could make the Dashboard more accessible to those who are fully visually impaired by alternative text
                “alt” to visual elements and perhaps add more text to the visuals themselves to supplement the
                non-textual visual elements where more possible.
            </p>

            <p> Question 5</p>
            <p>
                As I mentioned above, I could have added “alt” text to some of my visual elements such as the buttons in
                order to make my dashboard more accessible. This was particularly relevant in the final stages when I
                added DOM elements to supplement my SVG graphs and word cloud. I didn't get to do so because of time
                constraints and the fact my dashboard is accessible to my target audience ( the TA grader).
